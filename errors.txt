** ERROR CODES **

Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000

Line 15:7:  The href attribute requires a valid value to be accessible. Provide a valid, navigable address as the href value. If you cannot provide a valid href, but still need the element to resemble a link, use a button and change it with appropriate styles.

proxy error: Could not proxy request /api/tickets from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000.

Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules' 

Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client


** BLOCKERS **

Cannot seem to load ticket information into the edit form with componentDidMount. 

Can't seem to load the date time as a prop into the DOM after implementing Redux. "Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: Wed Aug 19 2020 11:04:57 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead."

Cannot seem to allow authorization for a logged in user to create, read, update, and delete tickets after implementing auth middleware to the routes. (GET http://localhost:3000/api/tickets/ 401 (Unauthorized))

Selecting a date in react-datepicker sometimes works and other times will display the selected date by one day off. 


**UPDATE 08/24/2020**

Solved most error codes and blockers. 

Sometimes I'll get the "could not proxy request" error code. Tried setting up "proxy" to 127.0.0.1 and setting "secure" to false in package.json. Super random error, doesn't seem to actually break the program though, seems to be a common issue on stackoverflow.

react-datepicker is still kind of buggy, sometimes works right and sometimes doesn't. Tried using other date pickers but haven't found a good one yet. 

Switched from implementing Redux to Context API instead. Both of these state managment tools are not actually neccessary for small-scale projects such as this one, however, I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of state management implementation. Went with Context API this time around, but will definetly implement Redux in upcoming projects.
